Math Riddler is based on one simple concept...learning should be fun! The game gives your brain a workout while making 
your belly laugh by solving riddles. 

Since children are more receptive to learning when it's play rather than work, it 
makes sense to teach them in fun ways. Math Riddler is an interactive game with different levels. The game motivates 
children by rewarding them with a good laugh for correctly answering math problems. Children advance to the next level 
after they correctly answer a set number of questions. Math Riddler helps build confidence while increasing skills. The 
game has settings for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Children are not only laughing, they solving math problems and learning to manipulate language. In fact, studies have 
shown that riddles stimulate student's metalinguistic awareness.
